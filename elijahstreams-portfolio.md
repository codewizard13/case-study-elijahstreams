# ElijahStreams / Elijah List Ministries
**Full-Stack WordPress Developer & Site Architect**  
*Jan 2023 – Nov 2025 · Remote*

---

## Overview
From 2023 to 2025, I served as the primary architect and full-stack WordPress developer for ElijahStreams / Elijah List Ministries. My work centered on rebuilding their entire platform twice—first migrating a legacy LAMP system into WordPress, and later replacing Elementor with a custom Bootstrap-based classic theme.

Across most of the role, I was the **sole developer**, responsible for the architecture, implementation, deployment, and ongoing maintenance of the platform.

## Key Achievements

### **2023 – Legacy LAMP → WordPress**
- Designed Figma wireframes and secured stakeholder approval.  
- Authored a multi-phase project document covering architecture, milestones, dependencies, risks, and plugin evaluations.  
- Built a custom Astra child theme and an accompanying site plugin to manage ACF CPTs, metadata logic, directory features, and reusable functionality.  
- Constructed a multi–CPT searchable directory with dynamic livestream integration.  
- Evaluated plugins, extensions, and tooling; **submitted purchase recommendations to direct supervisor for approval**.  
- Set up Plesk Obsidian, installed SSL certificates upon supervisor-approved purchase, configured WordFence, and improved system performance.  
- Maintained documentation and communicated progress through technical summaries sent to leadership.

### **2025 – Full Extraction from Elementor**
- Identified architectural limitations with Elementor (especially CPT relationship metadata).  
- Led a full rebuild using a **custom Bootstrap-based WordPress classic theme**.  
- Implemented Webpack builds, npm scripts (`dev` / `watch`), SCSS architecture, and a clean asset pipeline.  
- Developed modular PHP template structures, template parts, AJAX pagination, and polished CPT logic.  
- Replaced Elementor widgets—including the Wells stats page—with pure PHP template parts for long-term maintainability.

### **Automation & Internal Tools**
- Built custom **Google Apps Script functions** to extract GPS coordinates from URLs, convert DMS ↔ DD, and automate data cleanup for hundreds of wells used in the ministry’s mapping workflows.
